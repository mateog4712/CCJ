  summary: "Prediction of RNA pseudoknotted secondary structures using the CCJ algorithm."
  description: |
    CCJ is a computational tool for predicting RNA secondary structures with pseudoknots 
    based on Minimum Free Energy (MFE) models. It includes three implementations: Original CCJ, 
    Modified CCJ, and Sparse CCJ. Sparse CCJ, the recommended version, offers memory-efficient 
    predictions suitable for large RNA sequences.

    CCJ is implemented in C++ and requires a C++11-compatible compiler and CMake (≥3.1) for installation. 
    The software supports Linux and macOS environments and integrates the SimFold library for energy calculations.

    ### Key Features:
    - Predicts RNA secondary structures, including complex pseudoknots.
    - Offers three algorithmic variations: Original, Modified (DP09 energy model), and Sparse (optimized memory usage).
    - Supports single sequence inputs.
    - Designed for efficiency and scalability.
